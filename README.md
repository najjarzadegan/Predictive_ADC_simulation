# Predictive_ADC_simulation
This MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) provides a comprehensive simulation environment for analyzing the behavior of Predictive Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). The tool allows users to model the ADC architecture and observe system performance through both time-domain and frequency-domain analysis.
